"""
. Find a pair with the given sum in an array. Given an unsorted integer array, print a pair
with the given sum in it.
For example,
Input:
nums = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]
target = 10
Output:
Pair found (8, 2) or
Pair found (7, 3)
â€”
Input:
nums = [5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9]
target = 12
Output: Pair not found.

the code below goes through all the number with the inner is the list, and try to match with target number,
if target is match, it will show all the combination that match the target.

"""
Finds and prints a pair of numbers from the list `nums` that add up to the `target` sum.

    Parameters:
    nums (list of int): A list of integers.
    target (int): The target sum to find in pairs.

    Returns:
    None
